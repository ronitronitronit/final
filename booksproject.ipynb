The\\nmatter will probably continue to be decided by every one according to his\\nview of Seneca's character and abilities: in the matters of style and of\\nsentiment much may be said on both sides. Dion Cassius (lx, 35) says that\\nSeneca composed an [Greek: apokolokuntosis] or Pumpkinification of\\nClaudius after his death, the title being a parody of the usual\\n[Greek: apotheosis]; but this title is not given in the MSS. of the Ludus\\nde Morte Claudii, nor is there anything in the piece which suits the title\\nvery well.\\n\\nAs a literary form, the piece belongs to the class called\\n_Satura Menippea_, a satiric medley in prose and verse.\\n\\nThis text is that of Buecheler, with a few trifling changes, which are\\nindicated in the notes. We have been courteously allowed by Messrs\\nWeidmann to use this text. I have to acknowledge the help of Mr Ball's\\nnotes, from which I have taken a few references; but my translation was\\nmade many years ago.\\n\\nW.H.D.

The matter will probably continue to be decided by every one according to his view of Seneca's character and abilities: in the matters of style and of sentiment much may be said on both sides.

As a literary form, the piece belongs to the class called _Satura Menippea_, a satiric medley in prose and verse.

A small book it is; but thick, and all, save the last few pages, filled with a quaint but legible handwriting, and writ very close.

AUTHOR OF  WHAT IS WORTH WHILE? CULTURE AND REFORM THE VICTORY OF OUR FAITH     PREFACE  This work was begun nearly five years ago. Since then, the whole face of American history has changed. We have had the Spanish-American War, and the opening-up of our new possessions. In this period of time Gladstone, Li Hung Chang, and Queen Victoria have died; there has also occurred the assassination of the Empress of Austria and of President McKinley. There has been the Chinese persecution, the destruction of Galveston by storm and of Martinique by volcanic action. Wireless telegraphy has been discovered, and the source of the spread of certain fevers. In this time have been carried on gigantic engineering undertakings,--the Trans-Siberian Railroad, the Trans-Balkan Railroad, the rebuilding of New York. We have also looked upon the consolidation of vast forces of steel, iron, sugar, shipping, and other trusts. We have witnessed an extraordinary growth of universities, libraries, and higher schools,--the widespread increase of commerce, the prosperity of business, the rise in the price of food, and the great coal-strike of 1902. Perhaps never before in the world's history have there been crowded into five years such dramatic occurrences on the world-stage, nor such large opportunities for the individual man or woman.

INTRODUCTION   Youth, beauty, and love, wit, gayety and laughter, are the component parts of the delightful picture conjured up by the mere name of Giovanni Boccaccio, the prince of story-tellers for all generations of men. This creator of a real literary epoch was born in Paris, in 1313, (in the eleventh year of Dante's exile), of an Italian father and a French-woman of good family. His father was a merchant of Florence, whither he returned with his son when the child was seven years old. The boy received some education, but was placed in a counting-house when he was only thirteen, and at seventeen he was sent by his father to Naples to enter another commercial establishment. But he disliked commerce, and finally persuaded his father to allow him to study law for two years at the University of Naples, during which period the lively and attractive youth made brisk use of his leisure time in that gay and romantic city, where he made his way into the highest circles of society, and unconsciously gleaned the material for the rich harvest of song and story that came with his later years. At this time he was present at the coronation of the poet Petrarch in the Capitol, and was fired with admiration for the second greatest poet of that day. He chose Petrarch for his model and guide, and in riper manhood became his most intimate...</td>\n",

And the MS. itself--You must picture me, when first it was given into my care, turning it over, curiously, and making a swift, jerky examination. A small book it is; but thick, and all, save the last few pages, filled with a quaint but legible handwriting, and writ very close. I have the queer, faint, pit-water smell of it in my nostrils now as I write, and my fingers have subconscious memories of the soft, \"clo...   \n",

INTRODUCTION   Youth, beauty, and love, wit, gayety and laughter, are the component parts of the delightful picture conjured up by the mere name of Giovanni Boccaccio, the prince of story-tellers for all generations of men. This creator of a real literary epoch was born in Paris, in 1313, (in the eleventh year of Dante's exile), of an Italian father and a French-woman of good family. His father was a merchant of Florence, whither he returned with his son when the child was seven years old. The boy received some education, but was placed in a counting-house when he was only thirteen, and at seventeen he was sent by his father to Naples to enter another commercial establishment. But he disliked commerce, and finally persuaded his father to allow him to study law for two years at the University of Naples, during which period the lively and attractive youth made brisk use of his leisure time in that gay and romantic city, where he made his way into the highest circles of society, and unconsciously gleaned the material for the rich harvest of song and story that came with his later years. At this time he was present at the coronation of the poet Petrarch in the Capitol, and was fired with admiration for the second greatest poet of that day. He chose Petrarch for his model and guide, and in riper manhood became his most intimate...   \n",

ROUSE, M.A. LITT. D.                         MCMXX      INTRODUCTION  This piece is ascribed to Seneca by ancient tradition; it is impossible to prove that it is his, and impossible to prove that it is not. The matter will probably continue to be decided by every one according to his view of Seneca's character and abilities: in the matters of style and of sentiment much may be said on both sides. Dion Cassius (lx, 35) says that Seneca composed an [Greek: apokolokuntosis] or Pumpkinification of Claudius after his death, the title being a parody of the usual [Greek: apotheosis]; but this title is not given in the MSS. of the Ludus de Morte Claudii, nor is there anything in the piece which suits the title very well.  As a literary form, the piece belongs to the class called _Satura Menippea_, a satiric medley in prose and verse.  This text is that of Buecheler, with a few trifling changes, which are indicated in the notes. We have been courteously allowed by Messrs Weidmann to use this text. I have to acknowledge the help of Mr Ball's notes, from which I have taken a few references; but my translation was made many years ago.  W.H.D. ROUSE.

In this period of time Gladstone, Li Hung Chang, and Queen Victoria have died; there has also occurred the assassination of the Empress of Austria and of President McKinley.

CULTURE AND REFORM THE VICTORY OF OUR FAITH     PREFACE  This work was begun nearly five years ago. Since then, the whole face of American history has changed. We have had the Spanish-American War, and the opening-up of our new possessions. In this period of time Gladstone, Li Hung Chang, and Queen Victoria have died; there has also occurred the assassination of the Empress of Austria and of President McKinley. There has been the Chinese persecution, the destruction of Galveston by storm and of Martinique by volcanic action. Wireless telegraphy has been discovered, and the source of the spread of certain fevers. In this time have been carried on gigantic engineering undertakings,--the Trans-Siberian Railroad, the Trans-Balkan Railroad, the rebuilding of New York. We have also looked upon the consolidation of vast forces of steel, iron, sugar, shipping, and other trusts. We have witnessed an extraordinary growth of universities, libraries, and higher schools,--the widespread increase of commerce, the prosperity of business, the rise in the price of food, and the great coal-strike of 1902. Perhaps never before in the world's history have there been crowded into five years such dramatic occurrences on the world-stage, nor such large opportunities for the individual man or woman.

    "To have a more even distribution of the dataset, as well as to have more manageable data points that the text of an entire book, I create 200 data points for each year represented in the set. The 200 points are 5000 character portions of the books attributed to that year. For years with only a few books, the points from that year will have less variety, perhaps yielding worse results than the years with a variety of different books. I do this before tokenizing and other processing the text as the process will be less intense once the texts have been truncated."

When he had served out his term and been re-elected, a strong effort was made to prevent his taking his seat. It failed and in 1840, his fine was returned to him with interest.  It can well be understood that the passage and enforcement of such iniquitous measures caused alarm and indignation throughout the country.  Edward Livingston declared that they would \"disgrace Gothic barbarism.\" Jefferson's soul was stirred with the profoundest indignation. Under his inspiration, the Virginia assembly adopted resolutions calling on the state to nullify within its limits the enforcement of the Sedition act. The Alien and Sedition laws were declared unconstitutional, and the sister States were invited to unite in resisting them, \"in order to maintain unimpaired the authorities, rights and liberties reserved to the States respectively or to the people.\"  These views were not only those of Jefferson, but of Patrick Henry, George Mason and nearly all leading Virginians.  Kentucky, the child of her loins, seconded the action of Virginia, urged thereto by Jefferson who moulded her resolutions.  The revolt against the measures was so widespread that the Alien act was repealed in 1800, and the Sedition act in the following year....</td>\n",

He had no desire to inspect the Ural chain, where the malachite is hidden, nor the silver regions of Potosi; but he was all at once affected by a desire of \"visiting remote regions.\" It was a sudden irritability, which could only be quieted by travel.  Charles and his sister therefore went, without giving any notice to Coleridge, who, however, received them very kindly, and gave up all his time in order to show them the wonders of the neighborhood. The visitors arrived there in a \"gorgeous sunset\" (the only one that Lamb saw during his stay in the country), and thought that they had got \"into fairy-land.\" \"We entered Coleridge's study\" (he writes to Manning, shortly afterwards) \"just in the dusk, when the mountains were all dark. Such an impression I never received from objects of sight, nor do I suppose I ever can again. Glorious creatures, Skiddaw, &amp;c. I shall never forget how ye lay about that night, like an intrenchment; gone to bed, as it seemed, for the night.\"  They went to Coleridge's house, in which \"he had a large, antique, ill- shaped room, with an old organ, never played upon, an Aeolian harp, and shelves of scattered folios,\" and remained there three weeks, visiting Wordsworth's cottage, he himself ...</td>\n",

Of the things they possessed in common, greatest of all was their almost uncanny pull at each other's hearts. The day they left the hotel in Coronado she sat down on one of the beds while they were packing, and began to weep bitterly.  \"Dearest--\" His arms were around her; he pulled her head down upon his shoulder. \"What is it, my own Gloria?

Our two little beds here--side by side--they'll be always waiting for us, and we're never coming back to 'em any more.\"  She was tearing at his heart as she always could. Sentiment came over him, rushed into his eyes.  \"Gloria, why, we're going on to another room. And two other little beds. We're going to be together all our lives.\"  Words flooded from her in a low husky voice.  \"But it won't be--like our two beds--ever again.

Finally he lost, just a week before the armistice, one of his best friends, Ross McLean, a loss from which he certainly never recovered.  I have now, I think, brought together all the incidents that can throw any kind of light upon the final scene. In the middle of 1919 he retired from the army, and it was from this time to his death that I saw something of him. He went back to his old home at Horton's in Duke street, and as I was living at that time in Marlborough Chambers in Jermyn street we were in easy reach of one another. The early part of 1920 was a \"queer time.\" People had become, I imagine, pretty well accustomed to realizing that those two wonderful hours of Armistice day had not ushered in the millennium any more than those first marvellous moments of the Russian revolution produced it.  Every one has always hoped for the millennium, but the trouble since the days of Adam and Eve has always been that people have such different ideas as to what exactly that millennium shall be. The plain facts of the matter simply were that during 1919 and 1920 the world changed from a war of nations to a war of classes, that inevitable change that history has always shown follows on great wars.  As no one ever reads history, it was natural enough that there should be a great deal of disappointment and a great deal of astonishment. ...</td>\n",

When he had served out his term and been re-elected, a strong effort was made to prevent his taking his seat. It failed and in 1840, his fine was returned to him with interest.  It can well be understood that the passage and enforcement of such iniquitous measures caused alarm and indignation throughout the country.  Edward Livingston declared that they would \"disgrace Gothic barbarism.\" Jefferson's soul was stirred with the profoundest indignation. Under his inspiration, the Virginia assembly adopted resolutions calling on the state to nullify within its limits the enforcement of the Sedition act. The Alien and Sedition laws were declared unconstitutional, and the sister States were invited to unite in resisting them, \"in order to maintain unimpaired the authorities, rights and liberties reserved to the States respectively or to the people.\"  These views were not only those of Jefferson, but of Patrick Henry, George Mason and nearly all leading Virginians.  Kentucky, the child of her loins, seconded the action of Virginia, urged thereto by Jefferson who moulded her resolutions.  The revolt against the measures was so widespread that the Alien act was repealed in 1800, and the Sedition act in the following year....   \n",

Lamb had been more than once invited to visit the romantic Lake country. He had no desire to inspect the Ural chain, where the malachite is hidden, nor the silver regions of Potosi; but he was all at once affected by a desire of \"visiting remote regions.\" It was a sudden irritability, which could only be quieted by travel.  Charles and his sister therefore went, without giving any notice to Coleridge, who, however, received them very kindly, and gave up all his time in order to show them the wonders of the neighborhood. The visitors arrived there in a \"gorgeous sunset\" (the only one that Lamb saw during his stay in the country), and thought that they had got \"into fairy-land.\" \"We entered Coleridge's study\" (he writes to Manning, shortly afterwards) \"just in the dusk, when the mountains were all dark. Such an impression I never received from objects of sight, nor do I suppose I ever can again. Glorious creatures, Skiddaw, &c. I shall never forget how ye lay about that night, like an intrenchment; gone to bed, as it seemed, for the night.\"  They went to Coleridge's house, in which \"he had a large, antique, ill- shaped room, with an old organ, never played upon, an Aeolian harp, and shelves of scattered folios,\" and remained there three weeks, visiting Wordsworth's cottage, he himself ...   \n",

What he chiefly missed in her mind was the pedantic teleology--the sense of order and accuracy, the sense of life as a mysteriously correlated piece of patchwork, but he understood after a while that such a quality in her would have been incongruous.  Of the things they possessed in common, greatest of all was their almost uncanny pull at each other's hearts. The day they left the hotel in Coronado she sat down on one of the beds while they were packing, and began to weep bitterly.  \"Dearest--\" His arms were around her; he pulled her head down upon his shoulder. \"What is it, my own Gloria? Tell me.\"  \"We're going away,\" she sobbed. \"Oh, Anthony, it's sort of the first place we've lived together. Our two little beds here--side by side--they'll be always waiting for us, and we're never coming back to 'em any more.\"  She was tearing at his heart as she always could. Sentiment came over him, rushed into his eyes.  \"Gloria, why, we're going on to another room. And two other little beds. We're going to be together all our lives.\"  Words flooded from her in a low husky voice.  \"But it won't be--like our two beds--ever again. Everywhere we go and move on and change, something's lost--something's left behind. You can't ever quite repeat anything, and I've been so yours, here--\"  He held her passionately near, discerning far beyond any criticism of her sentiment, a wise grasping ...   \n",
       "29599   He had been always perhaps a little \"queer,\" as we are most of us \"queer\" somewhere, and the horrors of that horrible war undoubtedly affected him. Finally he lost, just a week before the armistice, one of his best friends, Ross McLean, a loss from which he certainly never recovered.  I have now, I think, brought together all the incidents that can throw any kind of light upon the final scene. In the middle of 1919 he retired from the army, and it was from this time to his death that I saw something of him. He went back to his old home at Horton's in Duke street, and as I was living at that time in Marlborough Chambers in Jermyn street we were in easy reach of one another. The early part of 1920 was a \"queer time.\" People had become, I imagine, pretty well accustomed to realizing that those two wonderful hours of Armistice day had not ushered in the millennium any more than those first marvellous moments of the Russian revolution produced it.  Every one has always hoped for the millennium, but the trouble since the days of Adam and Eve has always been that people have such different ideas as to what exactly that millennium shall be. The plain facts of the matter simply were that during 1919 and 1920 the world changed from a war of nations to a war of classes, that inevitable change that history has always shown follows on great wars.  As no one ever reads history, it was natural enough that there should be a great deal of disappointment and a great deal of astonishment. ...   \n",
